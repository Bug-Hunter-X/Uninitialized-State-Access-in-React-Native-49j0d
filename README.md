This repository demonstrates an example of uninitialized state access in React Native and provides a solution to fix the bug. Uninitialized state access can occur when a component attempts to access state or props before they have been fully initialized, leading to undefined values or errors. The example showcases the bug and the solution using the useEffect hook to ensure the state is initialized before accessing it.

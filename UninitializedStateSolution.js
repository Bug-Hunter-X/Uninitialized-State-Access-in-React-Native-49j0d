The solution involves using the useEffect hook to ensure that the state is initialized before accessing it. The useEffect hook executes after the component has rendered, so we can safely access the state inside the callback function.  useEffect(() => {  //Check that state is initialized before accessing it.  if (myState) {    console.log('State is initialized:', myState);  } else {    console.log('State is not initialized yet')  }}, [myState]);
